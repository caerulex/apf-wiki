# Dusk's Shadow

## Initial Encounter

> While Dawn's Shadow shone largely white, its salt surface only occasionally broken by crystal growths, Dusk's Halo shone an intense green. Waves of short, hair-like green fibers carpeted the ground.

> The kursi's craft followed behind the other ships, casting the far-off ground in shadow. The terrain largely consisted of gently rolling plains, all devoid of non-vegetative life. Five minutes into the flight, however, an enormous tilled field came into view. A rib-like superstructure the size of an airport. Using the superstructure as a scaffold were a number of small, moving metallic constructs that gleamed harshly in the sun. Many of these same constructs also tended to the field on the ground. To Lisa's eye, the ground constructs appeared to be doing nothing more than pace the field.

> "These must be the farming androids," Ida said, shaking her head slowly.
