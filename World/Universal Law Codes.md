# Universal Law Codes

## Summary

A set of unrestrictive, yet firmly-enforced laws existed throughout the universe. These laws were, conveniently, in the chip reader's encyclopedia.

Lisa was shocked by just how many there were, especially since, by all records, the universal laws were referred to as an "underlying foundation" intended to provide key tenets without delving into serious detail.

Bath and Lisa were both cognizant of the fact that, without the so-called Universal Law Codes, taking over the universe would be a near impossibility. They hadn't even thought to look for any kind of universal laws, not before Lepochim told them.

## Formal Surrender

Submitting to the dominance of another through formal surrender gives all gates to the dominant party, though no killing or mind-domination is required.

You need to have both parties at the surrender-er's primary gate. Then, you need to touch the sequence of lines on the gate just as instructed in the Universal Law Codes. And, if you touch the wrong lines in the wrong order, heaven forbid..."

Acting against the victor after a formal surrender is a universally recognized crime

> 'Perhaps I should look up wars over resources,' Lisa thought. 'Those kinds of wars would probably lead to surrender.'

> Lisa did just that, eventually finding a series of historical wars over resources a few hundred thousand years back in some area of the universe Lisa had never even heard of called Akila Galaxy. Akila Galaxy sought a large plethora of resources, from those intangible--intellectual property--to natural resources, to sapients.

> Lisa read out loud. "Two hundred thousand years ago, Akila Galaxy had just begun to stabilize itself as a key power in the Intermediary Strand. It established its power by conquering any gates within its immediate vicinity, taking conquered peoples as slaves." Lisa swallowed. "After the first few gates, Akila's reputation was such that any world it attacked would usually surrender, its Waymaster performing the surrender rite dictated by the Universal Law Codes. The rite of surrender doesn't provide any protections for those surrendering," Lisa murmured. "Akila Galaxy would treat the surrendered planets just the same as those it conquered through force...killing the former Waymasters on principle and enslaving the populace."

## World Devourers

> After reading through the Universal Law Codes, one thing had been made incredibly clear to Bath and Lisa: they could not, under any circumstances, publicly reveal that Bath was a World Devourer. Lepochim hadn't been lying when he first expressed his shock over a World Devourer existing on Earth. Simply reading the World Devourer page in the chip reader encyclopedia informed Lisa and Bath that, as soon as a World Devourer's location was established, Ildr would waste no time in deploying vacuum bombs.

> When Bath and Lisa looked up the vacuum bomb page, they discovered that these bombs effectively ripped an enormous hole in reality wherever they detonated, utterly destroying whatever planets--and gates--they touched. The first thing they did after reading this was confront Lepochim, asking him why, again, he neglected to bring up the existence of the Universal Law Codes.
