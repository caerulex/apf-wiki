# Kray City

## Rulers

### Initially

Edgewood: overseeing the city's defenses and organized combat training

Kayt: in charge of Kray City's facilities and normal operations

Anne: religious guidance - official chant: "Power is the Way of Kray."

#### Feudalism

> Because the city was located in Russia, one of the few countries that absolutely refused to submit to COTD, the majority of Kray's early residents were Russia's less-than-savory figures on the run from the government. As COTD gained more and more influence, increasingly large hordes of normal people entered the city as well...unfortunately, the shady folks who entered the city first had a palpable head start.

> They used this head start to set up a system of perverse feudalism. Edgewood assumed that the leader of religious guidance was supposed to prevent these kinds of things from happening, but Anne clearly didn't get the memo.

> As a result of this system of oppression, the spearrows absolutely ripped through Kray City like a hurricane, pecking many who engaged in instituting the system of feudalism to death. They attacked nearly 50% of the city, ultimately killing around 10% of the population.

> This, on its own, couldn't qualify as "wiping out" Kray City. No; the real shitstorm started as soon as all the people who had been oppressed had the opportunity to beat down on their heavily injured oppressors.

> That was when the casualties had really started to mount. Edgewood, Kayt, and Anne had all rapidly deployed their human and quasi-sapient subordinates to contain the damage, joining the fray themselves to engender order. Despite their efforts, by the time everything was under control, 40% of Kray City lay dead. The other 60% of its population were, almost without exception, wounded, though caretakers took care of their wounds easily enough.

> Ever since that day, Kray City had been noticeably different. It was a somber place, though inarguably a better place to live now that the feudalism was gone. Of everyone, Edgewood thought that Anne had been affected the most, if only because of how seriously she involved herself in her religious guidance position.
