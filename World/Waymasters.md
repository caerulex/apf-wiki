# Waymasters

## Summary

> Most worlds near the Core tended to use rather sophisticated aerial ships to travel at high speed through gates. They would have authorization frequency chips--gate passes-on the ships that would allow them to pass through certain gates without drawing undue attention. As a result, many worlds with stabilized gates had highways that flowed seamlessly from one gate to the next for hundreds of linked planets, all under the purvue of Waymaster conglomerates.

> Of course, buying a gate pass was somewhat pricy, though affordable for many Core dwellers, meaning that the people who distributed the passes--Waymasters--were wealthy individuals of great influence. Being a Waymaster almost guaranteed one enter the strange, nobility-esque upper sphere of intergalactic influence. Many people in high places benefited from currying favor with Waymasters, and the benefit was mutual. The position of Waymaster had served many in the past as a springboard upon which to enter coveted intergalactic politics.

> There was only one requirement to be a Waymaster: having ownership of at least one gate. The direction in which the gate allowed travel didn't matter--though of course two-way gates were most valuable--and the number of people who knew about and used the gate also had no bearing. Thus, because Bath had forcefully seized the Ritus headquarters, he was officially in possession of a gate and thus a Waymaster.
