## Humans

Mental faculty rating: 8

> "Humans rate very high on the scale. We're actually an 8," Jessup grinned. "We only know about worlds who have 6-ranked organisms or higher since they're the only ones with kursi. You can't open a gate unless you have a kursi, after all."

## Deepthink

Mental faculty rating: 7587/10000

There were definite differences between deepthink and humans. The largest similarity was in facial structure, which really did appear almost identical, with eye, nose, and mouth placement closely aligned between the two species. Deepthink and humans both had hair, though humans appeared to have much more hair than the deepthink. Deepthink had thinner shoulders than humans, with longer arms and legs as well as longer torsos. The average height of the deepthink was around six foot. The species didn't appear to have a clear gender distinction between male and female, which Lisa found was interesting. She hadn't found the information in the record that explained how reproduction worked, and since the gonads of the deepthink were grayed out, she couldn't extrapolate from biological anatomy. The information was likely too specific to be included in the general species overview page she was currently observing.

The species was listed as kursi compatible. A rating of 7587/10000 was given next to the kursi designation, which Lisa interpreted as the index of kursi compatibility for the deepthink species.

> "Wait; you're all adrenaline junkies?" she rumbled, voice dripping with disbelief. How could the verdora, the most stick-in-the-mud society imaginable, get high off of danger!?

> "Which is precisely why our society prevents us from coming into contact with dangerous conditions," he elaborated. "Leading to demand for escorts, fueling an economy of high-stakes adventuring, all of it illicit."

> "We come bearing no ill will. We swear upon the honor of the dead and fallen." This saying was one that Lisa found scouring verdora culture on the encyclopedia.
