# General Arc Information

> "...I told Radiance Bath that the Egdelek Arc is one of several arcs that contain profound mysteries. In order to form stable sigils, books from the other arcs must acquired. I discouraged him from moving around any books in the event that sigils might enter into unstable states."

> Lisa felt her heart pound. The sigils can go into unstable states? And just by moving around books, if I'm hearing right. This sounded too incredible to be real.

> "What is the scientific basis behind the sigils?" Lisa probed.

> "It is a profound mystery," the android replied, voice clinical.

> Lisa's mouth popped open. "Why are you transporting this library?"

> "To deliver the books to a secure location," AI Ninety-Seven stated blithely.

>"Is it perhaps the case," Bath began, gazing at the android with piercing eyes, "that you are not permitted to explain the scientific basis behind the sigils?"

>"No," the android replied, recoiling. "Such information is beyond my reach."

>So, the information exists...Lisa thought. "How many arcs are there?"

> When AI Ninety-Seven first welcomed us into the Egdelek Arc, it said two different numbers regarding its age. First, it said that its former master, Franz, left the Egdelek Arc twenty-six thousand years previous. However, only a few minutes later, I asked it how long it waited for my arrival." Bath's eyes peered intently into Lisa and Dean's. "It replied: two-thousand three-hundred and forty-one years."
