# The Egdelek Arc

## Initial Encounter

> Saw a seemingly...meditating android: it sat with its legs crossed and arms out, fingers curled. Its figure was similar, but not quite like, that of a human: its facial structure was more Lepochim-like than anything else, while it had three fingers on the right hand, four on the left, and four eyes, all of them closed.

> "Welcome, sapients: twenty-six thousand years past, my master, Franz, left me in this remote cavern. In compliance with his orders, I will give all here good fortune."

> "The Egdelek Arc, Vizier."

> "How long were you in stasis until my arrival?"

> "Two-thousand three-hundred and forty-one years."

> Lisa began to pace. "The ship's lone sapient occupant was transporting a library. We don't know the destination, but we do know that the ship encountered trouble in the Jeveda Galaxy after receiving missile fire from a ship called ATD-jefeal-0122." Lisa sighed. "I feel like Juserin would be able to make more sense of this than ourselves."

> Forced to retreat, Transporter Franz redirected his route to pass through three uncharted gates. In the end of this transfer, he ended up on planet 39811."

> Lisa recognized the number. That's Vast Desert.
