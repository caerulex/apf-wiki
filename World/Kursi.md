# Kursi

## Summary

`Kursi` is a term used to refer to sapients that are hosts to a queen kursi symbiote.

Kursis are sapients that have the ability to mentally influence other creatures and sapients seeded by the kursi symbiote. The queen symbiote prevents the aging process, and as their power increases with age, the eldest kursi can gain incredible power. However, many go insane or meet unnatural deaths.

> ...within 2.3 nonillion lightyears of Ildr, all organisms have been seeded with the kursi symbiote. However, only few symbiotes in every hundred million will actually be queens, and the requirement for a kursi to find a suitable host is that the host have a mental faculty rating of at least 6.

## Organizations on Earth

Ritus - has the Ritus gate

Fungsoeng (Hive in Cantonese) - aggressively search for queen symbiotes (kursi)

> Many prominent political figures are members of/have ties with Fungsoeng or Ritus. The two groups have been relatively balanced, with Fungsoeng members more numerous and Ritus having a bit more power from slaves. Both groups' members number no more than 1000 people, so having queen symbiotes is a pretty fucking rare event. This makes Lisa happy because being special is fun but also disillusioned because these two groups have very shaky morals and bad power-hungry ambitions and also aren't with the whole "save the environment" picture. They are both foes that Bath and Lisa will need to take down, foes that will likely be able to team up in the face of a serious threat.

## Within the Greater World

According the [Lepochim](../Characters/Deepthink/Lepochim.md), Earth's distance from habitable worlds is incredibly odd. In fact, the time it took for Earth to have its first seriously intelligent life took way too long, suggesting that Earth is extremely distant from the center of the universe, the Ildr, or the Deep, where most known dimensions have their central governments.

A superior board of lifeforms presides over the central government. These lifeforms are not always consistent across dimensions, but are always the first hosts of the symbiotes, which [Lepochim](../Characters/Deepthink/Lepochim.md) calls kursi. The kursi seemed to appear out of nowhere on every dimension. Nobody knows how they all just happened; not few organisms point to kursi as the creation of a God unbounded by something trivial like spacial dimensions. Either way, the kursi always have spreaded out from the universe center (which is essentially marked by the appearance of the first few kursi queens) and into the far reaches of space. Wherever they go, they reserve the ability to promote a higher level of intelligence building in the host than might have otherwise been possible through intelligent breeding. Selecting from a host population designated as having worth as an intelligent species, they seek to eventually give this population the tools to find the center of the universe itself and venture into the intrigue and politics of the universe in the current dimension.

## Queens

Only few symbiotes in every hundred million will actually be queens; people with queen symbiotes are called kursi.

> Symbiote queen inhabiting Lisa grants Lisa the ability to control other symbiotes. All creatures are infected with the symbiotes, which are a ridiculously prosperous species. The only wihtout the symbiotes are organisms too low to bother with and Bath, who changes form and cannot have a symbiote. This is really why Lisa cannot control him. His absence of mind is automatically registered in Lisa's brain as blackness, though really what it is is absence/void. Nobody know what the fuck the symbiotes are. They're incredibly tiny and can move all throughout the human body, not even necessarily concentrated in one place, so they avoid detection.
