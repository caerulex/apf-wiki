# The Church of the Dragon (COTD)

COTD is the religion created by Lisa and Bath to justify their conquering of Earth and other worlds to further their ultimate goal of world domination (see [Big WD](The%20Big%20WD.md)).

## Planning of COTD Theocracy - Excerpt

> "So, in this theocracy, what are the majority of people supposed to do?" They couldn't all be government officials. Bath knew they were probably listed somewhere in the ranking system but figured asking Lisa to explain was more efficient.

> "Ordinary people are either going to live with the intention of peace, or live with the intention of war. We're going to need a massive army if we're serious about conquest," Lisa asserted. "The base of peaceful society will be teachers, people who will spread knowledge.

> "Above them will be caretakers, people who serve others, whether through service-based industries or through production-oriented industries like agriculture. Above them will be the artists, who produce all sorts of works and popular entertainment. Above them will be the administrators."

> "This doesn't sound like all that much of a theocracy," Bath mused.

> "We don't need to invent any myths or legends about you. Those will invent themselves as we go on. Unlike other religions with gods that have been, on the whole, silent, the entire infrastructure of this world is going to rely upon you as its base. Moreover, because one of the goals for any sapients in this society will be to obtain the 'longevity' ability, they'll quickly buy into our mission: 'conquest.'"

> "The people who devote themselves to war will enter into a system I haven't really fleshed out yet, but suffice to say it'll be similar to a typical army with rankings and stuff.
