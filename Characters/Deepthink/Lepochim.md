## Summary

Lepchim is a sealed Kursi from Zder, the Enlightened Galaxy, just beyond the core worlds.

## Backstory

### Introduction

One of the slaves of Ritus, when Bath and Lisa are invited to visit, begs Bath to take him with them. The creature's name in translation is Branching Stairway, in his native language Lepochim. Lepochim is pretty fucking terrifying. He's a creature of war from one of the territories of the outer reaches of Sigenolf 74, a small solar system in a galaxy Bath has never heard of because Lepochim doesn't know a translation and also because it may or may not exist in this dimension. He calls that galaxy Zder. It allegedly means Bright. The bright galaxy because of its uncommonly high star density, with a huge host of habitable worlds.

> "Zder has many intelligent species, many of which are suitable as kursi hosts. While in the beginning, billions of years past, conflict existed between the many planets of Zder over resources and gates...in the end, the wars stopped. Zder has known peace for the past 12 billion years. Occasionally little conflicts break out every few billion years, but overall...Zder is very peaceful.

> "Zderians therefore spend resources not on weapons, but on knowledge acquisition. The libraries of Zder are renown throughout the cosmos."

> "I am from one of Zder's many small planets, Tu-71. Tu-71 isn't very remarkable, though it's a planet that absolutely casts Earth into a shadow," Lepochim sniffed, a bit of pride coming out.

—

> "I thought you said that Zder was a peaceful galaxy," Lisa pointed out.

> Lepochim scoffed. "It's peaceful internally. That doesn't mean it refrains from interactions with other galaxies and galactic powers."

> "In fact, I'm actually a special forces operative from Sigenolf-74. How else would I survive on all these different worlds, after all?"

> "So you aren't from Tu-71?" Bath had told her that Lepochim was from the small planet.

> "I'm from Tu-71. Sigenolf-74 doesn't exist, it's a secret."

> "Tu-71, a small planet near the center of Bright Galaxy." An image appeared of the planet, a blueish-white orb surrounded by black. "Age: 26 billion years. Primary economy: information technology, information brokerage."

—

> "Deepthink." Lisa thought the name a bit odd, and wondered what the untranslated name was. Nevermind; she figured that she'd find out how to see the actual name later, once she was more familiar with the chip reader.

> An image of a creature with white hair, pale pink skin, and an ominously human appearance came up on the screen. The Deepthink was naked, though a few areas where Lisa figured sexual organs were present were smoothed out.

—

> "Sigenolf-74 isn't an officially registered planet. It's a planet accessible by a single gate on the very fringes of Zder. It was disovered approximately 500,000 years previous by a high-ranking military conquest official. Since then, it's been a training ground for special forces."

> Lepochim sighed. "The penalty for telling all of you this is death,  by the way. Anyways: the operatives on Zder are all given a series of implants that alter our bodily compositions on the fly. It's actually quite similar to how you, Bath, manipulate Lisa's body after we enter each planet. The key difference is that the implants have a vast database of each planet's environmental conditions, with particular focus on conditions at the entrance to each gate.

> "Of course, there are some planets and gates that render the implants useless, such as the gate we just entered. I would've been incinerated before my body could adapt to the magma. However, for the most part, the implants work very well."
