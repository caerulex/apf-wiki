# Juserin

## Introduction

The sapient, clearly a male from his translated voice, looked to be a similar species, if not the same, as the escort. His skin was a pale blue, his mouths covered with an elegant scarf draped around the lower half of his face. He had a slightly-darker blue mane of hair around his head that extended out in thin lines of blue over his spine and limbs. The sapient appeared to stand on his back pair of legs, though like the escort, his entire body was covered in a dress-like shroud that covered his limbs.

## When Juserin Submits

> Bath knew that to Juserin, he and Lisa were still representing Earth, a planet that was truly at the very fringes of the civilized universe. Give up his own holdings and vastly superior technologies, just because he lacked the military might to contend with a planet of barbaric warmongers?

> Bath couldn't believe that Juserin would give in so easily. The man had at least 500 years of experience under his belt, Bath was sure of it. With this being the case, wouldn't Juserin have defenses in place? Bath simply couldn't fathom a world in which a seasoned Waymaster like Juserin was so...careless.

> "What will this do?" Juserin queried. "How can a seed refurbish anything? It's a plant." He sounded, to Lisa's ears, hopelessly confused, further locking in her image of Juserin as a proud, olden-days-loving noble that didn't understand the modern world. Lisa knew that this assessment was completely inaccurate, especially considering the fact that Illudis' technology far surpassed that of Earth...even so, the grandpa-noble image was one she vehemently latched on to, if only because she needed more humor in her life.
