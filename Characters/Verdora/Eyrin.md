> "...a group of thrill-seekers were adventuring in the Wilderness by my father's house. Their escort, a man named Tramin, found me, and took me back to Xelin. Effectively orphaned, I spent three years at the Hideaway, training to become an escort."

## Choosing a veil

> Eyrin traipsed over to his collection of veils, all of which floated in the air, suspended. He'd bring at most three during this voyage, washing them at the end of each day. He selected two single-colored veils for daily usage, a red and a light blue for the colors of Illusta, Illudis' capital, and Eyrus, the capital of his province. The third veil, for formal occasions, was more difficult to select. In the end, he chose a slightly sheer cloth with sharp, silver geometric patterns stitched onto a white background. Conservative, he thought as he pinched the veil between two digits. Not. The cloth wasn't intended to be translucent, though its light color allowed nearby sapients to see the outline of his jaws.

> The diplomatic side of Eyrin knew the veil was a poor choice. The pragmatic side argued otherwise: what a better veil for intimidating foreign sapients? He snapped his jaws together, inspecting how his fangs looked beneath the flimsy fabric. It'll do.

> Eyrus was a typical, cookie-cutter Candidate palace, one that Eyrin had acquired from a kursi that had decided to venture off Illudis as one of Juserin's ambassadors. Because he almost never walked through its halls, Eyrin took an extra minute to admire the geometric designs on the floors and the cloud-colored tapestries. Though he would never admit it, he felt a certain reluctance to leave Eyrus.

> When I return, Juserin may choose to disinherit me. As he walked down the hall towards the palace doors, servants froze like statues, prostrate before him. Isn't that my goal? he wondered, passing through the doors and into the courtyard between the palace and the gates to Eyrusta. He felt a sour taste in his mouth as he proceeded on, looking every bit the noble prince the public probably thought he was. I know what it is, Eyrin realized. Why I feel so uncomfortable with this change of events. It's because this isn't my plan, but Juserin's.
