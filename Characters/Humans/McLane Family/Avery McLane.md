> Before heading over to get food, Avery returned to her family's dwelling. While people of all ages could get their own apartment-style living quarters, no questions asked, Avery preferred to live with her parents. Even if they nagged her about staying safe, or attending her classes in school, she'd lived with them her whole life: living alone at the tender age of thirteen sounded, to Avery's mind, awfully lonely.

After Bath left, the McLanes had left Basalith to return to their present residence. They'd since refurbished the house with dragonleaf, such that the traditional, colonial-style home brimmed with green flourishes and tendriling vines.

> 'I need to focus on the plan, instead of getting upset over being left behind.' An image of Kray City popped up into her mind. 'That's the goal. In the next two years, I need to be the leader of my own dragonleaf city, just like Anne.' Information of all city leaders was public knowledge. As soon as Avery realized one of the leaders was just a high school dropout, she'd felt exhilarated.

> And along the way, she'd continue to amass power. When she had her own city, she'd be able to amass path points much faster. Then, she'd move on to other planets, established city-seeds there, and continue the cycle. She'd found her own schools, corporations, maybe even a line of clothes...
