## Thoughts on COTD

> Grey knew that some peacekeepers disliked their forced subjugation. They complained about being forced into mind-manipulating Earth's population, complained about the taskmaster Lepochim.

> He just didn't care.

> 'COTD has done more good than I have in...' Grey's mental train of thought faltered; he had lost count years ago of his age. He sighed, then surveyed the barren, gray wasteland that everyone called Lime World. He walked along the ridges of the steppes, wriggling his toes in the hard soil underfoot. He never liked shoes, though used them out of necessity. His feet no longer ached, their metal-like durability superior to any shoe of old.

## Encounter with the Sizikguron Arc

> Grey began to laugh, a booming, almost manic chuckle. "Our good fortune," he explained, "is the evacuated lair of a pirate." He laughed unabated. "Fezosisn isn't a species; it's an outlaw organization. Ludwig isn't an actual name, but a fake identity. The Arc?" He turned around and looked at their startled faces in the eye. "What is this place, if not a library, hmm?"

> "Since you're all so timid, I'll explain this for you: this place is freshly abandoned. Maybe one or two thousand years ago, give or take a few centuries. This vessel's lovely pilot, Ludwig, was transporting this vessel to an unidentified location.

> "However, somewhere along the way, he was attacked from afar; the assailant planted a sac of estevek eggs on the ship. Ludwig, unable to locate them, departed, leaving AI Ninety-Seven behind, along with the rest of this cargo ship. Now tell me, lady and gentlemen," he said, exhaling and catching his breath. "What was Ludwig's cargo?"

> "This is Sizikguron Arc," Grey chuckled, holding his arms up and out, as though beholding the heavens. "The Library of the Ninety-Seventh Era." His laugh became increasingly manic; soon, he was doubled over."
