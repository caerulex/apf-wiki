Also known as:

* The Church
* Asil

## Summary

## Abilities

* Magnetic Sense
* Flame
  * > She flared her palms, then rose above the floor. Flames suddenly danced over the air in patterns sketched out by her magnetic field. She adjusted the blast of flame by controlling the minuscule igniters in her palms: isolated, millimeter-sized, bead-shaped rounded-cylinders that could, at will, flip over to reveal normal skin. Lisa specifically sent the flames into a crown around her head, almost like a flaming halo.
* Echolocation boon
* > Using the extremely heat-resistant hafnium powder while using echolocation at the same time was extremely taxing. For one, controlling the powder was difficult since it wasn't an ionic substance, meaning that it didn't have a strong polarity. It was a huge challenge just to get the powder to follow magnetic fields close to her skin, let alone within a few feet of her body. On top of that, she needed to use echolocation to constantly monitor if there were any areas of her hafnium bubble where magma was starting to spew, a difficult task considering that magma was seeping through her shield everywhere.
