## Summary

## Thoughts on going off world

> "There's a reason why I'm still here," Edgewood had snapped. "Don't think it's because I love this city, or because I love Earth."

> "Then why...?" Edgewood had thought that this side of the teen, the reserved, confused side, was oddly endearing.

> He had then looked her square in the eye. "I'm not gonna die establishing a colony on some god-forsaken planet. Mark my words, kid: path points are the major currency now. Once people start to routinely earn years of lifespan, I'd bet yah 5 pp that they'll enter the economy as well. When that happens, people like us--the leaders--will, at the very least, be able to afford lifespan increases."

> "So you're saying that there's no rush," Anne had finished. "You're telling me to wait, then go later."

> "Exactly."

"Where's the excitement in that?" To Anne, exploring unknown worlds had the greatest appeal. Taking a pleasure cruise or winter vacation to nearby, already established planets sounded so...dull.

> To that, Edgewood had replied, "There's excitement everywhere; some kinds you just have to make yourself."
